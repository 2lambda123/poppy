Coronagraphs
============

Poppy has extensive functionality to faciliate the modeling of coronagraph point spread functions. In addition to the general summary of those capabilities here, see the examples in the notebooks subdirectory:
`POPPY Examples <https://github.com/mperrin/poppy/blob/master/notebooks/POPPY%20Examples.ipynb>`_
and
