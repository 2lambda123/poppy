Release Notes
===============

0.4
-------------------
To be released June 2014?

 * Astropy dependencies updated to 0.4; configuration system reworked to accomodate the astropy.configuration transition.
 * Several OpticalElements got renamed, for instance ``IdealCircularOcculter`` became just ``CircularOcculter``. These are all fairly
   idealized optics and it seems inconsistent to signpost that for only some of them. This is kept only for the FQPM to emphasize that one
   in particular uses a very simplified prescription and neglects refractive index variation vs wavelength.
 * Substantially improved unit test system. 
 * Some new utility functions in poppy.misc for analytic PSFs for comparison (and use in the test system).
 * Internal code reorganization, mostly which should not affect end users directly.


0.3
----------

Released April 7, 2014

 * Dependencies updated to use astropy.
 * Added documentation and examples for POPPY, separate from the WebbPSF documentation.
 * Improved configuration settings system, using astropy.config framework.

   * The astropy.config framework itself is in flux from astropy 0.3 to 0.4; some of the related functionality
     in poppy may need to change in the future.

 * Added support for rectangular subarray calculations. You can invoke these by setting fov_pixels or fov_arcsec with a 2-element iterable::

    >> nc = webbpsf.NIRCam()
    >> nc.calcPSF('F212N', fov_arcsec=[3,6])
    >> nc.calcPSF('F187N', fov_pixels=(300,100) )

   Those two elements give the desired field size as (Y,X) following the usual Python axis order convention.
 * Added support for pyFFTW in addition to PyFFTW3.
 * pyFFTW will auto save wisdom to disk for more rapid execution on subsequent invocations
 * InverseTransmission of an AnalyticElement is now allowed inside a CompoundAnalyticOptic
 * Added SecondaryObscuration optic to conveniently model an opaque secondary mirror and adjustible support spiders.
 * Added RectangleAperture. Added rotation keywords for RectangleAperture and SquareAperture.
 * Added AnalyticOpticalElement.sample() function to sample analytic functions onto a user defined grid. Refactored 
   the display() and toFITS() functions. Improved functionality of display for CompoundAnalyticOptics. 

0.2.8
----------
 * First release as a standalone package (previously was integrated as part of webbpsf). See the release notes for WebbPSF for prior verions.
 * switched package building to use `setuptools` instead of `distutils`/`stsci_distutils_hack`
 * new `Instrument` class in poppy provides much of the functionality previously in JWInstrument, to make it
   easier to model generic non-JWST instruments using this code.
