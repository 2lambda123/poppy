poppy: Physical Optics Propagation in Python
================================================

This module implements an object-oriented system for modeling physical optics propagation with diffraction, particularly for telescopic and coronagraphic imaging.

It was developed originally as part of WebbPSF, but is a stand-alone system capable of being used for
modeling of optical systems other than JWST.

For documentation, see http://www.stsci.edu/~mperrin/software/poppy/

Most code by Marshall Perrin, with some contributions from Anand Sivaramakrishnan, Remi Soummer, and others.
